# Write a Python program to check whether a given number is an Automorphic Number or not.

# Automorphic Number: A number is called an Automorphic Number if the square of the number ends with the number itself.

# Example Input and Output:
# Input: 5
# Output: True (Since 5^2=25 and ends with 5)

# Input: 76
# Output: True (Since 76^2= 5776 and ends with 76)


# Input: 12
# Output: True (Since 12 ^2 = 144 which does not end wth 12)
